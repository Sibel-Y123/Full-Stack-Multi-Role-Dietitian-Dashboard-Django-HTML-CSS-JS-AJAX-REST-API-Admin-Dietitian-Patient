Project Overview
The Full-Stack Multi-Role Dietitian Dashboard is a professional, web-based nutrition management platform designed for dietitians, patients, and administrators, providing an integrated solution for monitoring, analyzing, and managing dietary data efficiently.
The project combines backend (Django) and frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) technologies for a fully integrated, responsive, and interactive experience. Data is retrieved from a local MySQL database (via XAMPP) and augmented with live nutritional information from the USDA FoodData Central API through RESTful services. AJAX ensures seamless, real-time updates without page reloads.
This platform is suitable for clinical and professional applications, enabling secure and accurate management of dietary information across multiple user roles.
