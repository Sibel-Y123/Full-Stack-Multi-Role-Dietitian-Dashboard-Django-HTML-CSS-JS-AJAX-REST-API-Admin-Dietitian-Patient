Full-Stack Multi-Role Dietitian Dashboard (Capstone Project)
Independently developed full-stack web application integrating dietetics and technology
Project Overview
A professional, web-based nutrition management platform designed for dietitians, patients, and administrators. Provides an integrated solution for monitoring, analyzing, and managing dietary data efficiently. The system combines backend (Django) and frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) technologies for a fully responsive and interactive experience. Data is retrieved from a local MySQL database (via XAMPP) and enriched with live nutritional information from the USDA FoodData Central API through RESTful services. AJAX enables seamless, real-time updates without page reloads.
